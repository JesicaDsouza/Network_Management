# OSminiProject-Network_Management
In this project, the bash script for the Network management provides various system related information along with the Network information. The bash script consists of the most useful Networking commands and provides the system administrator with most of the internet connection information all at once, instead of executing the individual commands one by one. We have also implemented a feature wherein, the Bash script would scan and monitor the network using a combination of bash and ping commands. The script will scan networks for hosts attached to a specified IP address. The script will print a message if the ping command was successful or not. The project also displays various other data such as the system information, Routing tables, ARP tables, active connections, etc.
